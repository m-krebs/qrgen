# QRGEN
## About this project
[Browser extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qrgen/celhapemgmhhclbheiegnoeijimokpmg?hl=en-US), that gnerates a QR-Code for the current page's url.

This extension is simply a wrapper for the great qrcode.min.js script of [davidshimjs](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs). 
Not more, not less. Great! 

### Motivation
Most of the QR-Code generators I used, were kinda overloaded with text and things I didn't like. That's why I created this most minimal QRCode-generator.
